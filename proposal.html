        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p> 
            The topic of our application is personal computer (PC) building. Given the wide variety of PC components available, each type of component comes in numerous variations, 
            featuring distinct specifications and is uniquely manufactured by various brand. This wide array of components and the incompatibility of many parts makes PC building a 
            confusing process for both experienced and inexperienced PC builders. Yes, you can watch hundreds of tutorials and eventually learn about each component, brand, their
            compatibility, specifications, and how to put together a PC, but that takes hours and memorization. To avoid this confusion and extra effort, many people go with pre-built
            PC route. This is where a manufacturer builds a complete PC that is ready for consumers to purchase. However, this route has its drawbacks. Pre-built PC's often come with 
            a higher pricetag (compared to a self-built PC with similar components), poorer quality components, possibly lower performance, and possibly lack of customization and upgradability.

        <h2>App Description</h2>

                Be sure and review the overall project requirements for more details about the scope and requirements for your project.
                Your proposal will also contain a description of the web app that you will create to help address your chosen problem (a proposed "solution"). Think about what kind of a web app would help with this problem, and how people would use that app to make their lives better in some way. What is the "use case" or "user story"Links to an external site. for the app?
                Remember that this app will be interactiveâ€”it will need to contain buttons, forms, etc that let the user provide some kind of input and modify how data is presented to them. Thus your app will need to do more than just be something for the user to read; it needs to give the user something to do.
            </p>
            <h3>Your app should also be described in 2-3 paragraphs. In particular, you should make sure to address:</h3>
            <p>1) Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website? What impacts might this app have on minority groups?</p>
            <p>
                2) What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactive features are you expecting to provide? Remember that you app will need to include at least "two and a half" significant features; be sure to explicitly identify and explain what all of them are! Remember:
                Remember that "viewing" information or navigating ("going to") to something isn't a feature!
            </p>
            <p>
                3) What kind of information will the users be viewing? If intend to use data from an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
                If you insist on using an API, confirm that you'll be able to access it from a client-side app by testing it at https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/Links to an external site.. If you can't get data back from this testing site, then it won't work with your project.
            </p>
            <p>
                4) How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
                Remember the app doesn't need to have "business value". But as Informatics students we care about the practical usage and impacts of systems, not just their implementation. Be sure to consider that in your proposal!
